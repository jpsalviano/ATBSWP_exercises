-Chapter I - Python Basics-

Math operators in Python (from higest to lowest precedence): ** % // / * - +

Expressions are just values combined with operators, and they always evaluate down to a single value.

Data type: category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type. Most common: integers (int) like -2, 0, 5; floating-point numbers (floats) like -1.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.25; strings (str) like 'a', 'Hello!', '11 cats'.

Overwriting the variable: when a variable is assigned a new value, the old value is forgotten.

yourFirstProgram.py

Argument: a value that is passed to a function call.

print()
input()
len()
str(), int(), float()

Practice Questions

1:
* operator
'hello' value
-88.8 value
- operator
/ operator
+ operator
5 value

2:
spam variable
'spam' string

3:
integers, floats and strings

4:
values and operators
they evaluate to a single value

5:
the difference is on how the computer interprets the data - when the program is executed the expression is solved by the computer and it evaluates to a single value, while the statement feeds the computer with some kind of infomation and is not evaluated to a single value.

6:
20

7:
'spamspamspam'
'spamspamspam'

8:
a variable name can't begin with a number

9:
int(), float(), str()

10:
an integer can't be concatenated to a string nor a string can be added to a number
correction: 'I have eaten' + str(99) + ' burritos.'

Extra credit:
len():
	Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set).

round(number[, ndigits]):
	Return number rounded to ndigits precision after the decimal point. If ndigits is omitted or is None, it returns the nearest integer to its input.

Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations.
(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#tut-fp-issues)

"On most machines today, floats are approximated using a binary fraction with the numerator using the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit and with the denominator as a power of two. In the case of 1/10, the binary fraction is 3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55 which is close to but not exactly equal to the true value of 1/10."

Representation error -> explains the “0.1” example in detail.

-Chapter II - Flow Control-

Boolean values: True / False

Comparison operators: == != < > <= =>

Boolean operators: and / or / not

After any math and comparison operators evaluate, Python evaluates the not operators first, then the end operators, and the the or operators.

Elements of Flow Control

Flow Control Statements

if statements

else statements

elif statements
